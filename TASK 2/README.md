# ðŸŽ¬ Task 2 - Movie Rating Prediction with Python

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project predicts the *ratings of movies* based on features like *genre, director, and actors*.  
It uses *regression techniques* on historical movie data to estimate ratings given by users or critics.

The goal is to:
- Analyze historical movie data  
- Perform data preprocessing & feature engineering  
- Train machine learning regression models  
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like *MSE* and *RÂ²*
